Case Study 1: QuickFix - The Business Model Reboot
Role: Business Consultant / High-Level Business Analyst
The Situation: A Fumbling Tech Startup
QuickFix (a mobile app offering on-demand tech support for smart home devices) had achieved initial market traction but was suffering from severe structural fragmentation and an unsustainable business model. The founders were burning capital without a clear path to profitability.

The Core Mess:

Fragmentation Fiasco: They used a patchwork of four unconnected software tools (Billing, Support, Marketing, and Backend), creating data silos. This made it impossible to accurately track a customer's true value or diagnose churn causes.

Strategy Void: Their pricing was arbitrary, copied from a competitor, and not based on their actual cost-to-serve. They lacked a defined Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), meaning their marketing budget was being wasted acquiring unprofitable users.

Brand Confusion: The brand messaging lacked a consistent voice, leading to low customer trust and poor conversion rates on their public-facing channels.

The Action: End-to-End Strategic Transformation
My engagement involved a comprehensive diagnostic and restructuring effort across Strategy, Finance, Operations, and Branding.

Phase 1: Diagnosis & Strategy
Financial & Unit Economics Analysis: Built a new Unit Economics Model (in Excel/Sheets) using existing billing and support data. Calculated the true Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), which revealed that 65% of the current customer base was unprofitable due to excessive support costs.

Process Modeling: Documented the "As-Is" end-to-end customer journey (from acquisition to cancellation) using a BPMN Diagram (in Visio/Lucidchart) to visualize the data fragmentation problem and identify all broken hand-off points.

Organizational Review: Conducted stakeholder interviews and defined a Phase-Based Organizational Structure for the next 12 months, identifying critical missing roles needed to support the new strategy.

Phase 2: Defining the Solution & Deliverables
Strategic & Pricing Model: Defined a new, profitable Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and developed a Value-Based Pricing Model to increase margins and stabilize revenue.

Operational Requirements: Designed the "To-Be" System Architecture by creating a Requirements Specification Document for a Customer Data Platform (CDP). This CDP was the required solution to seamlessly integrate the four fragmented tools, eliminating the manual data workarounds.

Branding & Marketing: Established a clear Brand Voice Guide (The "Friendly Expert") and developed a targeted 12-Month Digital Marketing Plan focused entirely on acquiring the newly defined, high-value ICP.

The Result: Clarity, Efficiency, and Funding Readiness
My recommendations and deliverables provided QuickFix with the structured foundation and data-driven insights needed to scale profitably.

Area of Impact	Measurable Result / Outcome
Financial Clarity	Profitable Customer Base Identified. Marketing spend was immediately shifted to focus on the top 35% of high-value customers, stemming the capital burn.
Operational Efficiency	Data Fragmentation Reduced by 80%. The requirements paved the way for seamless data flow between platforms, allowing for accurate, real-time profitability tracking.
Revenue Potential	Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Potential Increased by 40% through the immediate adoption of the new Value-Based Pricing Model.
Strategic Direction	The finalized strategy, financial model, and clear roadmap provided the CEO with "North Star" Clarity and were instrumental in successfully securing follow-up investor interest.
